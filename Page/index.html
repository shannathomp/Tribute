                    <h2>Started investing right from an early age</h2>
                    Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett’s passion for entrepreneurship and stock trading was
                    nurtured by his father, Howard Buffett – a U.S. congressman. His profile in his senior yearbook read
                    “likes math; a future stockbroker”. He gained an enormous amount of experience while working in his
                    father’s stockbrokerage firm.

                    In his teens, he made close to $200 a month delivering The Washington Post newspapers. Other streams
                    of income came from investments he made in his father’s business. At one point in time, he also sold
                    chewing gum, golf balls, stamps, soda drinks, and weekly magazines, which he delivered door to door.
                    As at the time he was graduating from college, he had close to $10,000 saved in the bank.

                    He drew a lot of inspiration from a number of business books at the Omaha public library. Arguably,
                    his favourite was One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000 (1936) written by Frances Minaker. And at just
                    the age of 11, he bought three shares of a company called Cities Service.

                    Such was his passion that he contemplated going straight into business after high school; however,
                    his father insisted that the young Buffett first proceeds to college.pic

                    <h2>A big admirer of value investing</h2>
                    After graduating from the University of Nebraska with a Bachelor of Science in Business
                    Administration, Warren Buffet proceeded to enrol at Columbia University to pursue a Master of
                    Science in Economics. He chose Columbia because he wished to be mentored by renowned economist
                    Benjamin Graham.

                    Considered the father of Value Investing, Graham mentored Buffett, exposing him to sound investment
                    philosophies that seek out companies with high intrinsic value. Buffett’s guiding principle in
                    investment is that: He scans the market to find stocks whose prices are low compared to their
                    intrinsic value.

                    <h2>Established Buffett Partnership Ltd</h2>
                    A few years after graduate school, Buffett successfully secured a job at the firm of his mentor
                    Benjamin Graham. Shortly after, he went on to found Buffett Parntership Ltd. Beginning with three
                    partnerships in 1957, Buffett put in the hours day in, day out; and by 1960, his firm could boast of
                    seven partnerships.

                    In the next couple of years, he continued to grow his stake in the partnership. And as the return of
                    investment from his numerous portfolios kept increasing, Buffett’s worth crossed the 1
                    million-dollar mark.
